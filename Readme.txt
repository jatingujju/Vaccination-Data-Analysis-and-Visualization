# Vaccination Data Analysis and Visualization

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing vaccination data to uncover trends, patterns, and actionable insights.  
It involves **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations** to better understand:
- Vaccination coverage  
- Incidence rates  
- Category-wise performance  

The aim is to make complex vaccination data more accessible and meaningful through **clear visualizations**.
